# Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Identify the key differences between digital AI and physical AI
- Recognize the potential applications of humanoid robotics
- Explore the integration of perception, reasoning, and action in physical systems

## Introduction
The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, sensor limitations, and dynamic environments.

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from digital computation to embodied intelligence, where AI systems must understand and interact with the physical world in real-time. This integration of perception, reasoning, and action in physical systems requires new approaches to machine learning, robotics, and human-robot interaction.

## Key Concepts
- **Physical AI principles**: Understanding how AI systems can operate effectively in the real world, dealing with uncertainty, sensor noise, and physical constraints
- **Embodied intelligence**: The concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **Humanoid robotics landscape**: Overview of current humanoid robot platforms and their capabilities
- **Sensor systems for robotics**: Understanding various sensor modalities including vision, touch, proprioception, and their integration
- **Real-time processing**: The challenges of processing sensor data and generating actions within strict timing constraints

## Physical AI vs. Digital AI
Physical AI differs fundamentally from digital AI in several key ways:

1. **Real-world constraints**: Physical systems must operate within the bounds of physics, including limitations on speed, force, energy, and materials
2. **Sensor uncertainty**: Real sensors are noisy and imperfect, unlike the clean data often used in digital AI training
3. **Safety considerations**: Physical systems must operate safely around humans and in complex environments
4. **Embodied cognition**: Intelligence is shaped by the physical form and its interaction with the environment
5. **Multi-modal integration**: Physical AI systems must integrate multiple sensory modalities and actuation systems

## The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
The first module focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the "nervous system" for robotic applications. ROS 2 provides:
- Communication infrastructure for distributed robotics applications
- Hardware abstraction and device drivers
- Package management for robotics software
- Tools for debugging, visualization, and simulation

## Applications and Future Directions
Physical AI has transformative potential across multiple domains:
- Healthcare robotics for patient care and rehabilitation
- Manufacturing and logistics automation
- Search and rescue operations
- Personal assistance and domestic robotics
- Educational and research platforms

## Summary
This week lays the foundation for understanding Physical AI and its applications in humanoid robotics. Students will explore the fundamental differences between digital and physical AI systems, and understand the challenges and opportunities in creating intelligent physical systems.

## Next Steps
In the following weeks, we will dive deeper into ROS 2 fundamentals, learning how to create nodes, topics, services, and actions that form the communication backbone of robotic systems.
